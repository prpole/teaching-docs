#1. IDLE#

A. Have Windows users search for IDLE or, failing that, Python. Go to something like C:\Python34/

B. Have Mac users go to applications>Python 3.4>IDLE

C. Explain what IDLE is (Integrated Development Environment) and show how it works

#2. Review Python Commands#

A. Arithmetic; + - * / ** // %; clarify difference between 2 and 3, which is that floats are handled in a common-sense way now but integer division can be achieved by //
B. Text; print(); input(); 
C. String concatenation, converting types
D. Defining Variables
	i. include naming conventions with caveat about book practices
	ii. check this: capitals for constants? see PEP8

#3. Exercise#

Need: constants.txt, wordcounts.txt, pseudocode.txt, objective.txt (display the latter)

A. Objective: write a program that accepts inputs for POS counts of a text, then returns a normalized figure, deviation, and number of standard deviations away from the mean for our sample. Then, check to see if there is an abnormal number of any POS for the text, saying "abnormally [high/low] number of [pos]" if so.

B. Texts: House of Mirth, Portrait of a Lady, Red Badge of Courage, The Financier, Tender Buttons.

C. Depending on time: try to generate text instructions together (see pseudocode.txt)

D. Displaying text instructions, ask students to code separately with small groups as support

E. The above may take as long as 30 minutes. To cut down on time of data entry, have groups of students work with one or two parts of speech each, coming together at the end to get the whole picture.
