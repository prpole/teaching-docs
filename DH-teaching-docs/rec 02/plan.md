1. Install Python

Go to python.org, click 3.4, download and install; if people get stuck, ask those around them (5 or so min)

2. Webpage

	A. Permissions
	
		- log in to CUNIX
		- navigate to public_html
		- make example.txt with some text
		- note that it's not there. Why?
		- Changing permissions using chmod
			* display picture of permissions
			* display public.md
			* go through both
		* Exercise: change permissions of example.txt and navigate in webbrowser

	B. HTML (take less time, skip put/get)

		- logout CUNIX
		- make example.html
		- explain three tags: html, img, a; and closing
		- use try using cyberduck/mobaxterm session to drag that file into public
			* cyberduck: make connection to cunix.columbia.edu using username/password
			* mobaxterm: start sftp session
		- check permissions and navigate to it
		* Exercise: make index.html using one link to columbia homepage

3. Playing with Python

	A. open python IDE and play around

		- print name
		- assign name variable as your name
		- print name via variable

	B. Word Counts

		- pull up my homepage /wordcounts.md
		- explain the numbers, why wordcounts are sometimes used, etc; numbers good as ballpark
		* Input exercise: assign each of these values to a variable, coming up with a useful naming scheme for variables
		- difference between float and integer, why this matters for division
		- basic arithmetic exercises: operators + - * / ** 
		- arithmetical functions: sqrt(x), abs(x), round(x), max(x1,x2,...,xn), min(list)
		* Exercise: find percentage of each text that are adjectives and nouns using your variables, plus the ratio of adjectives to nouns for each
