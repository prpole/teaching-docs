#Bigram Comparison# 

1. Objective: We're going to take the first chapters of two Edith Wharton novels and create a list of bigrams for each. Then, compare the two lists and return all common bigrams. This will return a list of every two-word phrase the chapters hold in common.

Digression: does anyone know why I keep giving us works from the first two decades or so of the 20th century or earlier? This is a matter of public domain; explain that public domain is frozen at 1923 until 2019, at which time it will start advancing again: 95 years after publication. This is because copyright was extended by Congress in 1998 for the financial benefit of copyright holders. 

2. Explain bigrams:

    - ngram concept, bring up Google Ngram viewer 
    - Go through the moving window concept, writing sentences on the board and drawing moving window, also presenting list of bigrams

3. Load up chapters:

    - download whartons_words.py
    - show how to import: import the file, then from file import *
    - explain imports briefly

(Beginning with generating lists of bigrams, then comparing bigrams if time)

4. Discuss pseudocoding (make empty list myself, etc., just get into the meat. The point here is translating that moving window into list indexes, cycling through, and avoiding index errors)

5. break off to code; start with doing bigram lists, inviting those ahead to go on to comparison; if people get done with bigram lists, talk about what is needed to compare and go back to coding
